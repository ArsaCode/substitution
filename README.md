Hello ! This is the Substitution key encrypter made for the Problem Set 2 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.
The user should input the key in the command prompt after the ./substitution key (key as a 26 characters long input) command.

The software works as follows :

1 . Get the users input and checks if it's valid
2 . Assigns the key entered by the user to an integer
3 . Gets the plain text from the user
4 . Ciphers the text using Substitution cipher method
5 . Prints back the ciphered text in result for the user.
